    <h1>Fault Tolerance</h1>
    

    <p class="ingress">When we put the blog in production, and started taking backup of the database, we found
        a serious problem.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p> 

            <p>The freaking blog software freezes every night!</p>

            <p>It didn't do this while in test and QA environments.</p>

            <p>The application seems to be running (status page tells load 
               balancer everything is OK), but doesn't respond to HTTP
               requests to show blogs (no reply, just hangs).</p>

            <p>The only relevant difference we can think of is that we restart the database
            while we take a backup snapshot. Can this cause the blog system to hang!?</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>Regards,<br/> 
            BOFH</p>

    <h2>Task</h2>
    
    <p>Run a performance test while you stop and start the database to
       reproduce the problem of stopped database during nightly backup.</p>
    
    <p class="tip">Pressing enter in the "mvn exec:java" shell stops the database.</p>
    
    <p class="tip">
        Create a JMeter test which demonstrates <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DBCP-28">this issue</a>.
        The test should run database-dependent code with moderate load while the database is restarted.
        Keep an eye on the <a href="status">status page</a> to see what happens with the connection pool.
