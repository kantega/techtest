    <p>Some of out bloggers are on stereoids. We think it is because of the 
       new feature to automatically get instagrams and tweets up as blog
       posts. Øysteins "what I ate for dinner taken with a crappy camera"-blog
       is one of the blogs that get most frequently updated with new posts.</p>
